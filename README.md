Living costs are rising, food scarcity is becoming more prevalent, and time is always in short supply. **CreateIT** was designed with a simple yet powerful goal: to help users save money on groceries by leveraging the ingredients they already have at hand. This mobile application prototype integrates with APIs to recommend meals based on available ingredients, offering a practical and delicious solution to everyday meal planning.

## 📚 Synopsis

  <summary><strong>Overview</strong></summary>
  
  ### Project Ideation
  During the first year of my degree in **Information Technology**, I was given a task to develop a mobile application prototype as part of the **Information Technology Professional Practice** class. This project involved working in a team of four, with each member assuming a role typically found in a real-world project team:
  
  - 🖌️ **Graphic Designer**
  - 📊 **Marketing & Domain Researcher**
  - 💻 **Software Developer**
  - 🔧 **Quality Assurance Tester**
  
  Although we each had distinct roles, collaboration was key, and we worked across all areas to deliver a cohesive and realistic project.

  <summary><strong>Problem under Analysis</strong></summary>

  The core objective was to design a mobile application prototype that addresses a societal issue. After much brainstorming—and many hungry study sessions—we decided to tackle a growing problem: **the rising cost of food**.

  While solving world hunger was beyond our scope, we identified a feasible approach: helping users make the most out of the ingredients they already own by recommending recipes. 🍳 This concept not only saves money but also reduces food waste.

  <summary><strong>Reasons for this Approach</strong></summary>

  We chose this direction after evaluating key factors such as:
  
  - **The demographic most affected by rising food prices**
  - **The availability of major food retailers across South Africa**
  
  Our team, **CreateTech**, aimed to mimic the essential functionality of a food purchasing app, with features including but not limited to:
  
  - 👤 **User Login/Signup**
  - 🛍️ **Browsing Products**
  - 🛒 **Purchasing Products**
  - 📈 **Finalizing the Purchase & Receiving a Receipt**

  The scope was intentionally kept manageable, ensuring we could deliver a functional prototype that met our objectives.
